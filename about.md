## About me

I'm a mathematical biologist. I'm fascinated by cell physiology: how do cells do the jobs they need to do, when they need to do them? My studies have focused primarily on hormone-producing cells in the pituitary gland, the pancreas, and the pineal gland. I build models of cell electrical activity and signaling and study their nonlinear dynamics. I also use machine learning and statistical modeling to understand genomic and other kinds of experimental data in collaborations with other researchers.

Having grown up skiing and windsurfing in British Columbia, Canada, I'm an outdoor enthusiast. I enjoy DIY projects and making technology-oriented interactive art.

I'm currently a staff scientist in [the Laboratory of Biological Modeling](https://lbm.niddk.nih.gov/) at the National Institutes of Health.
